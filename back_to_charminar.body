	<p>It was Raviteja's birthday today, so I went with his gang to Old Town, where we gorged on chicken biryani (crazy delicious, also very spicy) then walked to Charminar.</p>
	<p>I can't quite describe the journey, but for now suffice it to say that after about six hours, I arrived home with the earnest belief (and fear) that one can be killed with kindness.</p>
