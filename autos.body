	<p>When there's as many people as there are here, its worth it to have a smaller vehicle! Hense these cute little taxis they call "autos". It's like riding on a golf cart, except you don't have to golf (*sigh of relief*).</p>
	<p>Also, look carefully at the photo above. There an extra taste of India in there for you.</p>

	<p>Seriously these things are everywhere. If you cough and it sounds even vaguely of the word "auto", three drivers will immediately surround you asking where you want to go.</p>
