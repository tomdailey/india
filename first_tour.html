	<h2>A First Tour</h2>
	<h5>with some lovely hostel-mates, July 21 2019</h5>
	<img id='featureimage' src='images/walking_through_Lodi_Park.jpg'>
	<p>I left the hotel in Mahipalpur for a hostel in Saket, a middle-class neighborhood closer to the city-- and very near a lovely <a href='Delhi_metro.html'>metro</a> stop. The hostel had a nice common area where I met Anand, who was in town to help out friends of his old roommate, Hanna and Solomon from Ethiopia (all three pictured above). They were kind enough to invite me on their tour of some local parks and the <a href='Delhi_art_district.html'>Delhi art district</a>.</p>

	<p>We had an awesome morning, and by the time the sweltering afternoon heat began, I was napping on the terrace of the hostel, and working on the blog.</p>
	<p>Later in the afternoon I went with Maja and Olvie (two other hostel-mates) to check out little Tibet-- only after getting completely soaked in a good ol' monsoon. On the auto ride there, (you won't believe it) I shivered! I was actually pretty cold! For dinner Solomon made an <a href='ethiopian_dish.html'>ethiopian dish</a> which was really really good!</p>
	<p>I'm pretty sold on the whole hostel travel style. So many awesome people if you force yourself to say hello!</p>
