	<p>This is Charminar, a big Muslim monument in Old Hyderabad. Back in the day (400 years ago) the city was the capital of wealthy Muslim kingdom. The character of the city is defined by this, with a large population of Urdu-speaking Muslims, and famous foods like Biryani (which I guess was their invention).</p>
	<p><i>Char</i> means four, and <i>minar</i> means tower. It's crazy because the monument actually has four tower-like things in each corner. It's really symmetrical and intricate, you can stare at it a while and still not have all the patterns understood.</p>
  <p>We went to see it in the middle of the night which was cool, cause it was a good temperature and no one was around. I ended up <a href='back_to_charminar.html'>going back</a> a few days later mid afternoon and it was super busy. Kind of State Fair-esque.</p>
