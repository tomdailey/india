	<p>We didn't arrive to Madhira until like 4 am, there were some things to do in Hyderabad, and we stopped for dinner on the road. I'm very tired, but this is the perfect place to relax.</p>
	<p>Sumathi has been making delicious food, and I've slept a lot. Above is a view from the roof of the Kolluru's house. Everything is made from stones, wooden frames are only used for the doors, and the house is very simple and practical. No extra space or waste. I still haven't found a garbage can though. I don't know what to do with wrappers or trash (and I can't get a straight answer from anyone it, or I don't understand anyway.)</p>
	<p>Lekh showed me some of the town today, it's very cool to see the way of life. Here she is with that American 'tude she's learned:</p>
