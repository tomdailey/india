    <p>I left the airport and headed toward the metro. Two men jovially approached, asking "You want the metro? Tickets up there" and they pointed back up to the surface. I saw the machine to buy tickets I just figured I'd do it down below, but they were saying it needed to be above. Okay. We walked a while and they complimented me and were very friendly. We got to the surface and they started explaining how so and so lived down town and was going there anyway, just give him a hundred ruppees and he'd get me there. I understood.<p>
    <p>After several minutes of trying to say no politely, and after having my arm grabed and pulled to the vehicle, I shouted sternly, "Enough!" That surprised them, and I went on my merry way. Guilt reering its head, as I thought about what if Drakbar or whatever his name was really was a nice guy just taking me downtown. Maybe that was a good price?</p>
		<p>I made the right call though, because not only is downtown Delhi not the place I really wanted to go, but also the metro is just lovely. It's the coolest places around (technologically and climatologically).</p>
		<p>My short walk through Delhi was So I happily got back on when I discovered my phone wasn't working. I got it fixed back at the airport.<p>
    <p>There's lot's to adjust to, but that why its so fun. I'm tired though. On the metro I kept dozing off thinking that I was hereing other passengers speaking in english about somehting that interested me, then I'd sort of wake up to realize it was just Hindi. I got to the hotel, took a walk, and fell asleep at 3pm. But I woke up at 4 which was nice-- all the yogis do that.</p>
