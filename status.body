	<p>My apologies for the irregular updates, friends. I've enjoyed making this blog, and I hope you've enjoyed reading it. There will be more!</p>
	<p>I'm headed to a silent Vipassana retreat tomorrow, and will be without any technology (including pen and paper!). Unfortunately I haven't finished updating the blog to the present. There have been and will be some other interesting adventures I'm excited to tell you about, so stay tuned after September 15 for updates!</p>
	<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
