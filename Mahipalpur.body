	<h5>And onto planet India, July 19, 2019</h5>

	<p>There's so much going on here! Check out this street in Mahipalpur (small neighborhood near Delhi airport). Power lines and improvised drainage are indicative of much over here!</p>
	<p>I stayed one night in this village, and have since moved to a more developed part of Delhi. I'm glad I started here though. It really felt like another planet! Now that I've found the paved streets and the airconditioned cafes it feels more like planet Earth.</p>
