	<p>It's strange to travel with people you can't fluently communicate with. You don't know where you're going, or for how long you'll be there. You're trying to graciously accept hospitality, but can't make your preferences clear. It's tricky.</p>
	<p>Notice in the picture how the guy in the bottom left has his arm around his friend. This is totally normal to them. They mosey down the street holding each other like this, constantly being honked. I can't fathom why they chose to double their width in an environment already so treacherous to navigate. Being their new friend, I was being being escorted like this, a prisoner to the clutches of their kindness. For hours I was pushed to the side, knocked, ruffled, and stumbling through the deluge of urbandom.</p>
