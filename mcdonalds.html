	<h2>Coffee Quest II</h2>
	<h5>August 15, 2019</h5>
	<img id='featureimage' src='images/mcdonalds.jpg'>
	<p>I found it. I found a place where you can get a proper cup of American coffee (pretty close anyway, they still insist on filtering <i>milk</i> instead of water). It really feels like home. I've probably gone four times now. Last time I got a tour which was cool!</p>
	<p>It was really funny the way the worker giving me the tour was anticipating my reactions, as if I somehow knew how a McDonalds was supposed to run by virtue of my being American. Little does he know I'm just some shmo who barely passed his federally-mandated high school McDonalds Management class.</p>
