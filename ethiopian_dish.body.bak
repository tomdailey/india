	<p>Solomon is a chef back home, and came with some teff for exactly this occasion. teff is a common grain in ethiopia, with which is us to make this sort of bubly peta. He then broke the peta, and cooked chunks of it into this sour-spicy combo. Very tastey.</p>

	<p>He and Hanna just finished their first of five Vipassana medition retreats they'll do while in the country. Vipassana is a medition practice revolving around "mindfulness." The retreats entail varying degrees of isolation/bans on communication of any sort. Buisness idea: Vipassana retreats for high powered executives-- they pay thousands and you just give em a bed and some rice. Call it "Scarcity Meditation" or something.</p>
