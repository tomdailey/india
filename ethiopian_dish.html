	<p>Solomon is a chef back home, and came with some fhet for exactly this occasion. Fhet is a grain native to ethiopia, with which this sort of bubly peta is made. He then cooked chunks of said peta into this sour-spicy combo. Very tastey.</p>
	<img id='featureimage' src='images/ethiopian_friends.jpg'>
	<p>He and Hanna just finished their first of five Vipassana medition retreats they'll do while in the country. Vipassana is a medition practice revolving around "mindfulness." The retreats entail varying degrees of isolation/bans on communication of any sort. Buisness idea: Vipassana retreats for high powered executives-- they pay thousands and you just give em a bed and some rice. Call it "Scarcity Meditation" or something.</p>
