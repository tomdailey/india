	<h2>Reading Room Friends</h2>
	<h5>August 10, 2019</h5>
	<img id='featureimage' src='images/reading_room_friends.jpg'>
	<p>At the beginning of the week I finally managed to join a reading room. I saw signs all over the place, and went down four different dead ends (bad info from google, bad info on a sign etc...). Anyway it's been nice because it means I don't have to go to a Coffee Day every time I want to sit comfortably for a few hours.</p>
	<p>Today a couple reading roommates invited to their place for lunch which was really cool. There apartment is very simple and very comfortable. There's two rooms with blankets on the floor where the ten of them sleep, there's a main room with a barrel of water and an open space for eating, and a kitchen. We got four different curries from a street stall, made some rice, and everyone sat in a circle on the floor. It was pretty cool. I couldn't follow the conversation (although they use a lot of English sprinkled around), but it was great to be a fly on the wall.</p>
