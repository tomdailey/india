    <p>It was a good day-- I had to do a lot of waiting, and I ended up going back to the airport to "activate" my SIM card again (something the salesperson thought I understood through a mere non-verbal osmosis of information apparently). It was a pain to get back into the exit terminal place without coming of of a plane-- but it can be done for a fee if you leave you bag at the office two blocks down-- oh but don't leave your passport there.</p>
