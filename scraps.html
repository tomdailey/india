    <p>It was a good day-- I had to do a lot of waiting, and I ended up going back to the airport to "activate" my SIM card again (something the salesperson thought I understood through a mere non-verbal osmosis of information apparently). It was a pain to get back into the exit terminal place without coming of of a plane-- but it can be done for a fee if you leave you bag at the office two blocks down-- oh but don't leave your passport there.</p>



    <p>I left the airport and headed toward the metro. Two men jovially approached, asking "You want the metro? Tickets up there" and they pointed back up to the surface. I saw the machine to buy tickets I just figured I'd do it down below, but they were saying it needed to be above. Okay. We walked a while and they complimented me and were very friendly. We got to the surface and they started explaining how so and so lived down town and was going there anyway, just give him a hundred rupees and he'd get me there. I understood.<p>
    <p>After several minutes of trying to say no politely, and after having my arm grabbed and pulled to the vehicle, I shouted sternly, "Enough!" That surprised them, and I went on my merry way. Guilt rearing its head, as I thought about what if Drakbar or whatever his name was really was a nice guy just taking me downtown. Maybe that was a good price?</p>
		<p>I made the right call though, because not only is downtown Delhi not the place I really wanted to go, but also the metro is just lovely. It's the coolest places around (technologically and climatologically).</p>
		<p>My short walk through Delhi was So I happily got back on when I discovered my phone wasn't working. I got it fixed back at the airport.<p>
    <p>There's lot's to adjust to, but that why its so fun. I'm tired though. On the metro I kept dozing off thinking that I was hearing other passengers speaking in English about something that interested me, then I'd sort of wake up to realize it was just Hindi. I got to the hotel, took a walk, and fell asleep at 3pm. But I woke up at 4 which was nice-- all the yogis do that.</p>
