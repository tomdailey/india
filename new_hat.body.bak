	<p>The Kolluru's, in addition to the enourmous generosity throughout my stay, also sent me off with an Indian "lungi"-- an old fashioned lower-body garment worn like a bath towel. Uma also showed me another use for it.</p>
	<p>I guess workers wear these for sweat absorbtion, hair containment, and convienient storage of an all-purpose rag. Maybe we can sell the idea to Cabella's or Bass Pro Shop: "A new and revolutionary multi-purpose thread matrix"</p>
	<p>Getting a little stir crazy in this tiny little hostel room, as you can tell. I'm going to try and find a place to go during the day where I can study Telugu and use my laptop. The hostel has no such facilities, only a bed on which to sleep and eat.<p>
